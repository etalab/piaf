piaf is an open source text annotation tool for human. It provides annotation features for text classification, sequence labeling and sequence to sequence. So, you can create labeled data for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text summarization and so on. Just create project, upload data and start annotation. You can build dataset in hours.

First of all, a big thanks to the Doccano team since this is an adaptation from this project.

## Deployment (not maintained)

### Heroku

piaf can be deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) by clicking on the button below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Of course, you can deploy piaf by using [heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

```bash
heroku create
heroku stack:set container
git push heroku master
```

### AWS

piaf can be deployed to AWS ([Cloudformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)) by clicking on the button below:

> Notice: (1) EC2 KeyPair cannot be created automatically, so make sure you have an existing EC2 KeyPair in one region. Or [create one yourself](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair). (2) If you want to access piaf via HTTPS in AWS, here is an [instruction](https://github.com/chakki-works/piaf/wiki/HTTPS-setting-for-piaf-in-AWS).


## Features

* Collaborative annotation
* Multi-Language support
* Emoji :smile: support

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Django 2.1.7+
* Node.js 8.0+
* Google Chrome(highly recommended)

## Installation

First of all, you have to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etalab/piaf.git
cd piaf
```

To install piaf, there are three options:

<!-- **Option1: Pull the production Docker image**

```bash
docker pull chakkiworks/piaf
``` -->

**Option2: Setup Python environment**

First we need to install the dependencies. Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd app
```

Next we need to start the webpack server so that the frontend gets compiled continuously.
Run the following commands in a new shell:

```bash
cd server/static
npm install
npm run build
# npm start  # for developers
cd ..
```

**Option3: Pull the development Docker-Compose images** [recommended]

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

## Usage

### Start the development server

Let’s start the development server and explore it.

Depending on your installation method, there are two options:

<!-- **Option1: Running the Docker image as a Container** -->
<!--
First, run a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d --name piaf -p 8000:8000 chakkiworks/piaf
```

Then, execute `create-admin.sh` script for creating a superuser.

```bash
docker exec piaf tools/create-admin.sh "admin" "admin@example.com" "password"
``` -->

**Option2: Running Django development server**

Before running, we need to make migration. Run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Next we need to create a user who can login to the admin site. Run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py create_admin --noinput --username "admin" --email "admin@example.com" --password "password"
```

Developers can also validate that the project works as expected by running the tests:

```bash
python manage.py test server.tests
```

Finally, to start the server, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Optionally, you can change the bind ip and port using the command
```bash
python manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>
```

**Option3: Running the development Docker-Compose stack** [recommended]

We can use docker-compose to set up the webpack server, django server, database, etc. all in one command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now, open a Web browser and go to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/>. You should see the login screen:

<img src="./docs/login_form.png" alt="Login Form" width=400>

### Create a project

Now, try logging in with the superuser account you created in the previous step. You should see the piaf project list page:

<img src="./docs/projects.png" alt="projects" width=600>

There is no project created yet. To create your project, make sure you’re in the project list page and select `Create Project` button. You should see the following screen:

<img src="./docs/create_project.png" alt="Project Creation" width=400>

In this step, you can select three project types: text classificatioin, sequence labeling and sequence to sequence. You should select a type with your purpose.

### Import Data

After creating a project, you will see the "Import Data" page, or click `Import Data` button in the navigation bar. You should see the following screen:

<img src="./docs/upload.png" alt="Upload project" width=600>

You can upload two types of files:
- `CSV file`: file must contain a header with a `text` column or be one-column csv file.
- `JSON file`: each line contains a JSON object with a `text` key. JSON format supports line breaks rendering.

> Notice: Piaf won't render line breaks in annotation page for sequence labeling task due to the indent problem, but the exported JSON file still contains line breaks.

`example.txt` (or `example.csv`)
```python
EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.
President Obama is speaking at the White House.
He lives in Newark, Ohio.
...
```
`example.json`
```JSON
{"text": "EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb."}
{"text": "President Obama is speaking at the White House."}
{"text": "He lives in Newark, Ohio."}
...
```

Any other columns (for csv) or keys (for json) are preserved and will be exported in the `metadata` column or key as is.

Once you select a TXT/JSON file on your computer, click `Upload dataset` button. After uploading the dataset file, we will see the `Dataset` page (or click `Dataset` button list in the left bar). This page displays all the documents we uploaded in one project.

### Define labels

Click `Labels` button in left bar to define your own labels. You should see the label editor page. In label editor page, you can create labels by specifying label text, shortcut key, background color and text color.

### Annotation

Now, you are ready to annotate the texts. Just click the `Annotate Data` button in the navigation bar, you can start to annotate the documents you uploaded.

<img src="./docs/annotation.png" alt="Edit label" width=600>

### Export Data

After the annotation step, you can download the annotated data. Click the `Edit data` button in navigation bar, and then click `Export Data`. You should see below screen:

<img src="./docs/export_data.png" alt="Edit label" width=600>

You can export data as CSV file or JSON file by clicking the button.

Each exported document will have metadata column or key, which will contain
additional columns or keys from the imported document. The primary use-case for metadata is to allow you to match exported data with other system
by adding `external_id` to the imported file. For example:

Input file may look like this:
`import.json`
```JSON
{"text": "EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.", "external_id": 1}
```
and the exported file will look like this:
`output.json`
```JSON
{"doc_id": 2023, "text": "EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.", "labels": ["news"], "username": "root", "metadata": {"external_id": 1}}
```
