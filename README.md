[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/b64ba7294eca479181b52d30a7d2e9d7)](https://app.codacy.com/app/guillim/piaf?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=etalab/piaf&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/etalab/piaf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/etalab/piaf)

<abbr title="Pour Une IA Francophone">Piaf</abbr> is an open-source QA (question answering) annotation plateform.  
It handles the following features :  
* nice UI (conceived by a designer)
* contributor enrollment (signup & mail validation)
* contributor certification (by any member of the _admin_ team)
* _admin_ team administration (by the super-admin)
* input/output of texts to be annotated using the SQuAD format
* users scoring (for bot and troll removal)
* annotations managment


## 1. Installation

First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etalab/piaf.git
cd piaf
```

Then create the environment variables (you can customise your API keys and passwords):
```bash
cp .env-example .env
```


Now you have tow options : install the app with Docker or without

### Installing with Docker

As a prerequisite, you need to have installed Docker & Docker-compose on your computer.

Then, type:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

### Installing without

As a prerequisite, you need to have installed on your computer:

* Python 3.6+
* Django 2.1.7+
* Node.js 8.0+
* Chromium (recommended)
* Vue cli 4.4+  (more info [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html))


First install Python dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev  # Linux/Debian only
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Secondly, install Vue cli (if needed):

```bash
sudo npm install -g @vue/cli@latest # In Linux/Debian
```

Then compile the frontend:

```bash
make build-statics
```

> When developing the frontend, you may prefer watching for files changes.
> Run `npm start` (instead of `npm run build`) for building and hot reloading.

## 2. Running


### Running with Docker

```bash
make up
```
Note that it **takes a few minutes** to be up and reunning.  
Have a look at the Makefile for more details
### Running without

First prepare the database:

```bash
cd src
python manage.py migrate
```

Then create the admin user:

```bash
python manage.py create_admin --noinput --username "admin" --email "admin@example.com" --password "password"
```

And finally run the Django server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

> Note that Django permits to run the server on a different IP or port. `python manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>`

## 3. Setting up your annotation campaign

### Reach the Admin panel
Open your web-browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/ and login with the admin you created above (username: "admin", password: "password")

You will then be able to reach the admin panel, for any administration task you may require:
[127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin)


### Import texts

We designed a simple interface for you to upload in an easy way your texts you want to annotate. It's located here : [/app/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/admin)

Here is an example of input dataset: [Click here to download](/input-dataset-example.json)

As you can see in the example above, texts have to match the [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) format. But, for additional app options, we accept some extra fields :
- __"categorie"__ : can be one of the followings - 'Religion', 'Géographie', 'Histoire', 'Sport', 'Arts', 'Société', 'Sciences' default to 'Société' if empty
- __"displaytitle"__ : if you need a more deligthful title (falls back to title if empty)
- __"reference"__ : integer like *7138870* for Wikipedia reference (falls back to 0 if empty)

## 4. Annotation campaign

Simply reach : [app/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/)  
And give your users this URL so they can begin to annotate.

#### Admin section

To manage users, you can reach the admin dashboard : [admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)

## 5. Export results

Once you have some annotated texts, you may want to download them so you can train your own QA model for instance. Please, download the result on the page : [app/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/admin)




## 6. Configuration

## - General configuration

Passing most settings as environment variable will override the default settings. Here are some of the variable customisable:

```bash
DJANGO_ALLOW_SIGNUP=True # Allow users to singup (for crowdsourcing)
DJANGO_USE_MAILJET=False # use Mailjet or the native Django mail service
DJANGO_MAILJET_API_KEY=ffdfsfcfs2a00ad5ef367bfdsflsdk # put your Mailjet API key here, this is an example resulting in Errors
DJANGO_MAILJET_SECRET_KEY=nhf41cc0d45ffsdfs6fdsfdsffdsfsf # put your Mailjet API secret here, this is an example resulting in Errors
MATOMO_SITE_ID= # Matomo id
WEBPACK_ENVIRONMENT_PRODUCTION=False # build the frontend  or run a 'npm run serve'
```

### with Docker
Edit the .env file

### without
Set the environment variable before launching your server
```
DEBUG=0 MATOMO_SITE_ID=77 src/manage.py runserver
```

this will disable debugging and activate Matomo tracking for instance

### - Special Configuration for the VueJS app

There are some specific settings in a second `.env` file (it was simpler for us to keep two files). These settings are directly related with the frontend options. You will find it at this location : `src/piaf/front/.env`  

```bash
VUE_APP_ALLOW_ONBOARDING=true # Redirect new users to an onboarding process to teach them how to annotate a text
VUE_APP_PRINT_BRAVO=false # Option to hide the "Bravo" page after questions are submitted
```

## Troubleshooting & Contact

Feel free to [submit any feedback here](https://github.com/etalab/piaf/issues/new).

### Run VueJS app alone
It's possible to run the frontend application by itself. For this to work out, you will need :
- change `base: '/app'` into `base: '/'` in the file _src/piaf/front/src/router.js_
- make sure `publicPath: '/'` in the file _src/piaf/front/vue.config.js_
- to go to this folder _src/piaf/front_ & run `npm run watch`
- and start your server from _src/piaf/static/front_ where npm builds the app.
